# Petr Pošík

I work as a lecturer at [Dept. of Cybernetics](https://cyber.felk.cvut.cz), [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://fel.cvut.cz), [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz). At our department, I currently serve also as a deputy head for education. See my [contacts](./contacts.md).

## Teaching
Winter semester:
* [Problem Solving and Games](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/b4b33rph/start) (in Czech)
* [Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/a0m33eoa/start) (in English, if needed)

Summer semester:
* Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence ([in Czech](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/b3b33kui/cviceni/start) and [in English](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/be5b33kui/cviceni/start))

In the past:
* [Artificial Intelligence](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/b3m33ui) (in English)
* [Statistics and Reliability in Medicine](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/a6m33ssl/start) (in Czech)
* [Programming Essentials](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/be5b33prg/start) (in English)
* Data Mining (in Czech)
* [Applications of Artificial Intelligence](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/old/courses/y33aui/start) (in Czech)


## Research interests and community services

I am interested in methods lying at the boundary of optimization, evolutionary computation, and machine learning. See my [publications], [Web of Science profile](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/D-4658-2009), [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9694-3673), [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sn86E_IAAAAJ).

Nowadays, as a lecturer, I cannot spend much time doing research. Nevertheless, I am still a member of the editorial board of Evolutionary Computation Journal, MIT Press, and serve as a reviewer for other journals (e.g., IEEE Trans. on Evolutionary Computation) and conferences (GECCO, IEEE CEC, PPSN).
